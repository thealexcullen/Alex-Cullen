Here are some of my projects! Most of my work has been in r, but I have experience in Python, C, and Java.

The Post-Outing-Pitchers is an R markdown file that creates a pdf output for a given pitcher in a Trackman csv
We use these to give guys progress updates and an easy to read report about their performance

The iz_work.r is very very early work for a project we are working on at Mizzou Baseball. 
We are trying to gauge command within our pitchers and give a score for each pitch corresponding with a location target. 
As of right now I am just playing with some simple distance and score calculations to get an idea of our best command guys.

The appy_work.r is just a collection of little side projects or data searches I did while working for my Appy League Team.
This mostly includes stuff my coaches would ask me or graphics he requested I produce.
